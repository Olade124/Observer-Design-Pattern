# Observer Design Pattern
This repository is dedicated to Built a real-time order tracking system in Java using the Observer Design Pattern. Modeled a one-to-many relationship where customers (observers) receive automatic updates from an order system (subject) as status changes. Implemented dynamic observer registration, unregistration, and notification. This project demonstrates loose coupling, event-driven programming, and solid OOP principles in a practical, real-world scenario.
